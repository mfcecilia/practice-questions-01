Multiples of 3 and 5<br>
Time Limit: 2 seconds<br>

Project Euler 1: https://projecteuler.net/problem=1<br>

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Given some number N, what is the sum of all multiples of three and five that are strictly less than N?

Input<br>
Each input will consist of a single integer on a single line giving N(10≤N≤10,000)N(10≤N≤10,000).

Output<br>
Output a single number on a single line, giving the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below N.
